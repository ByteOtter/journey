This is the source code and content for my personal blog. You can find it here: [byteotter.gay](https://byteotter.gay)

To get the source code, you first need to clone the repository with the themes submodules.

```
git clone --recurse-submodules -j8 git@github.com:ByteOtter/journey.git
```

Make sure you have `hugo` installed on your system. Then you can run a development server with `hugo server -D`. This
launches a server at `localhost:1313` and reloads the page after each change.
