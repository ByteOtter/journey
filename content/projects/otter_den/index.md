## My first serious dabbles with coding

The Otter Den was my first serious attempt at building my own application. So I did what probably everyone has done at some point: I took a [Video Guide](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MwZwr5Tvyxo&list=PL-osiE80TeTs4UjLw5MM6OjgkjFeUxCYH) I found on YouTube and begann following it step by step.

While I had programming courses in uni they were not nearly as extensive or well explained as this video series and I started understanding programming concepts and Python in particular better and better, to a point where I did not want to just follow the tutorial. I wanted to expand upon it. And I wanted to do so in a way that my friends can watch my progress and help out here and there.

So I stopped following it and set up a [GitHub repository](https://github.com/ByteOtter/OtterDen) and expanded upon it. I added the ability to upload images in a reasonable way, (safe) hyperlink detection and a couple more.<br>
I used the opportunity to experiment with different stuff and was able to get a feeling for the language aswell as for concepts and things like databases, APIs and frontend.<br>
I would probably never want to build a web application myself to be honest but it was a great experience to finally have a project of my own I could tinker around with instead of trying to help out my friend with his Qt projects which I really did not understand the codebase of really well.

While Otter Den helped me learn a lot about programming aswell as `git`, GitHub workflows and everything around that works, I have since moved on to a different project, smaller in scope technically, but much more usable.

This story does not really have a takeaway I guess. It is much more a short ramble about how I got to my first (more or less) serious project that also helped me score this apprenticeship.
