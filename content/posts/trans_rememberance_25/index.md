Hey There ...

I know, it's always serious topics like these when we meet lately.
But it's Trans* Rememberance Day, so I thought, maybe it's time that we have another honest chat again.

So take a hot choclate, or maybe a tea if you feel like it. And snuggle up in that blankie; it's cold enough outside.

To be honest, I have been struggling to find the right words lately. You too?
Maybe it's because words alone cannot soften the fears
and the pain we feel as a community. Maybe it's because the weight of all that's going on is too much right now.

The coordinated attacks on our existence, for the simple act of trying to live as ourselves, can feel unbearable. And today especially, that hits differently.

I share your fears, the uncertainty, the frustration.

On this day we remember those whose lives had been cut short. Whose lives were taken for simply being who their were.
This day, November 20th, is a day that should not exist. A day born from the loss of people who deserved so much more time,
more joy, more life.

I would like you to pause reading here for a minute. And think about the 281 trans* people we lost in the past year.
281 lives cut short by violence, intentional systemic failures, or the isolation we all know too well.
If you would like to use this time to pay your respects to the ones who passed,
you can do so at [tdor.translivesmatter.info](https://tdor.translivesmatter.info/).

Okay, are you back with me? Please, take a break anytime you need to. Okay?

Taking breaks is very important. Especially nowadays ... You good? Okay ...

You know, this tradition of rememberance began on November 28th, 1998. Rita Hester, a young African-American transgender woman,
was brutally murdered in Allston, Massachusetts. She was killed for simply existing. She wasn't the first. And heartbreaklingly,
she would not be the last.

Violence against us has increased drastically in past years.
I have asked myself many times: *Why us? Why the hatred, the violence, the attempts of erasure?* We have always been here.
Just like all queer people. The first reports of gender non-conforming people go back thousands of years to the very
cradles of civilisation. Many indigenous people recognized more than two genders and it is scientific fact that we exist
unphased by outside influences.

Noone "becomes trans*".

We simply are.

We always were.

No matter when we came out.

No matter when we transitioned, are transitioning ... or never got the chance to.

We exist. We are real.

Yet ... I still sometimes fall into this loop of desperation: *"Why us?"*.

But asking this, or trying to meet the hatred with any kind of rationality is just wasted energy. We are not dealing with rational people here.
But one thing is for certain, and I want you to remember it: **We are going nowhere.**

Not today, not tomorrow, not next year.

We will stay right where we are, hand in hand, more courageous and united than ever before.

Even the ones who were taken from us; they are still here.

In our memories.

In our hearts.

Whether we knew them personally or not, their stories live through us.

Despite the best efforts of many politicians, demagogues, and religious or ideological zealots, we will not forget them.

Nor will we break under their pressure.

This is the best way we can honor the memories of the people we lost:
By continuing to support and love each other; by fighting for each other, by continuing
to accept and love ourselves, even in the hardest of times.

And we are not alone in this fight: In London, a hundred thousand people took to the streets in protest and a massive
show of salidarity. They marched in direct opposition to their government's de-humanizing policies targeting trans* people.
In solidarity with each and every one of us. Shoulder to shoulder with the ones we lost, and the ones who will come after
us. And this is not an isolated event either. In other European countries, and the United States, similar patterns emerge.
Not only for our rights, but the rights of every human being on earth to live their life as they see fit without
fear of oppression, discrimination or violence. They march in direct opposition to their governments trying to silence
them.

History is on our side. We have always survived.

This day is about remembering, yes. But it's also about looking forward; about fighting for a future where we can live freely and without fear.

And we will fight together, you and I. In our own tempo, in our own battles. But united as one.

So, if you're ready, go out there. Link up with your siblings, your partners, your friends. Have each others backs.
Support, protect and love each other. Help organize peer support systems, or amplify the voice of gender diverse folks
across your community. All of you have voices that should be heard. Deep and high, loud and quiet.

A whisper to a person in need can be just as important and powerful as a marchig call at a protest.

Every action matters, may it be visible or not.

We are all one people on this beautiful green planet. We all deserve love, protection and happiness as much as the person next to us.

Especially you. :heart:

So keep your head up. Everything will be fine in the end as long as we stick together. You'll see.

And if you ever feel scared: Please know I'm right here next to you, having your back.<br>
We're all in this together.

You are **valid**. You are **beautiful**. You are **worthy**. And **everything will be alright**. Pinky promise.

As always: With love, huggies and headpats.

Your,
