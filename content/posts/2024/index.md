Dear 2024,

I've been waiting for this moment -- the one where I can finally say goodbye.
It's strange, addressing you like an old friend. But isn't that what you were? You came into my life uninvited, and at first,
I wasn't sure if I wanted you around. Now, as we part ways, I realize you've left a mark I'll always carry with me.

You hurt me, 2024. Let's not pretend otherwise. You broke my heart in ways I never saw coming. You brought me people 
who seemed like they loved me. Sweet and tender moments, something that felt real. And then, everything shattered.
Time and time again I was hurt, abused. Mentally and physically. It left me questioning myself, questioning whether I'd 
ever deserve the kind of love that stays. 
This kind of pain -- it's not something you walk away from without scars. I've spent nights picking at them, 
wondering if they'd ever heal.

You frustrated me, too. Oh, how you frustrated me! So many days felt like wading through mud, trying to hold on to dreams 
that seemed to slip away faster than I could catch them. The world felt heavy, and I felt small.
There were moments I thought this was my last step. That you'd win and crush me.

And yet, you didn't.

Because somewhere between the heartbreak and frustration, you gave me something unexpected: clarity. You forced me to 
look in the mirror, to sit with myself in the quiet moments and ask questions I'd spent years avoiding. Who am I? 
Who have I always been?

Turns out, the answers were waiting all along. I'm Tiara, a woman who has been waiting -- aching -- to emerge from 
behind the walls I built to survive. I didn't see it at first; the fear of what might happen if I said it out loud kept me silent.
But you, 2024, besides the ones who hurt me, also gave me people who helped me strip the chains that held me.
My friends -- steadfast and loving -- stood by me. They reminded me of my worth when I doubted it most. 
They gave me the courage to see myself, embrace myself, and to take those terrifying first steps toward being who I truly am.
And for that, I thank you.

This year, I took my first steps toward becoming the person I was always meant to be. They weren't easy steps; they came with 
their own kind of breaking. Breaking free of old expectations. Breaking through years of denial. Breaking into a world that still 
sometimes feels like it might not be ready for me. But I took them. I took them, and I'll keep taking them, no matter how hard 
the road ahead might be.

And you also made sure I didn't have to do so alone. In your final moments with us you introduced me to a very special someone.
Someone so gentle, so caring, so kind, so intelligent and beautiful. Someone who understands the weight of this journey and has 
the rare ability to calm my restless mind. To make me feel safe. I don't know where our path will lead us, but I am so grateful 
they have entered my life. And I promise you to cherish and support them in every way I can.

2024, you broke me, but you also laid the groundwork for me to rebuild. You showed me that the pieced I'd been holding together 
in the wrong shape could finally be rearranged into something beautiful. You taught me that I'm strong enough to face the world 
as my trues self, even when it's hard, even when it hurts.

So, as I let you go, I'm holding onto the lessons you've given me. I'm holding onto the pain, the love, the clarity and the courage.
I'm greeting 2025 with a heart that's still healing but also wide open, ready to embrace whatever comes next.

Goodye, 2024. I'll never forget you.

Love, 

- Tiara
