# Welcome to the Inklings

As you know, I am sort-of (posing as) an amateur author, and
scribble some stories from time to time.

These `Inklings` - as I will call 'em now - will spend their existance
on here, if they are good enough.

They may or may not be part of a greater story, the book I am writing,
or just random shit I came up with on a whim.

Enjoy your read!

Hint: Not all of these stories will be in English, some will be in German
instead, so ...
