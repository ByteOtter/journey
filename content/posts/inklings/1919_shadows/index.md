**A cold night in London, October, 1919.**<br>
The entire european continent had been in the firm grip of war for five years, with no
end in sight. And back home in London people fought their own battles every day.<br>
Economic stagnation, rationing of even the most basic of goods, food shortages and disease
lead to unrest and rioting in the streets during the day and to crime and violence at night.<br>
The gap between the haves and havenots has never been greater.

Prostitution, rape, burglary and murder was commonplace, especially down at the docks - where laws and life
were worth about as much as the filth on the streets.<br>
Finding bodies was not particularly difficult and even the younger soldiers patrolling the streets during the day
grew used to it quickly. Not that they had a choice in the matter, anyway.<br>
What began around June however, shook London's public to its core.

In a matter of weeks the mortuaries around the city were filled with corpses and whatever was left of them. Some
were missing limbs, some were ripped apart and some appeared to have been mauled to death.

London had seen its fair share of deranged serial murderers over the last few years. Some were deranged doctors farming
organs to sell from beggars and folk who would not be missed.

Some were rich people hunting the weakest of society for sports. Some wer just plainly deranged with a violent past to prove it.<br>
And an increasinglz large number of them were veterans of the war who came back posessed by the blood lust which posessed them
in the trenches.

These murders, however, were different. Each of the former targeted a certain people, operated on a certain method. The bodies that 
flooded our mortuaries during that time were of all walks of life, all ages - with no pattern to the madness.

It got so bad even the majority of criminaly did not dare to exit their hiding holes during moonless nights.
Only the really desperate could be seen couring under bridges and makeship shacks dimly lit by burning trash, praying to survive the night.

It is this setting, in which my story begins. My name is Johnathan Edwards and at the time I was a Corporal in *His Majestie's Army*.
