**A cold night in London, October, 1919.**<br>
The entire european continent had been in the firm grip of war for five years, with no
end in sight. And back home in London people fought their own battles every day.<br>
Economic stagnation, rationing of even the most basic of goods, food shortages and disease
lead to unrest and rioting in the streets during the day and to crime and violence at night.<br>
The gap between the haves and havenots has never been greater.

Prostitution, rape, burglary and murder was commonplace, especially down at the docks - where laws and life
were worth about as much as the filth on the streets.<br>
Finding bodies was not particularly difficult and even the younger soldiers patrolling the streets during the day
grew used to it quickly. Not that they had a choice in the matter, anyway.<br>
What began around June however, shook London's public to its core.

In a matter of weeks the mortuaries around the city were filled with corpses and whatever was left of them. Some
were missing limbs, some were ripped apart and some appeared to have been mauled to death.

London had seen its fair share of deranged serial murderers over the last few years. Some were deranged doctors farming
organs to sell from beggars and folk who would not be missed.

Some were rich people hunting the weakest of society for sports. Some wer just plainly deranged with a violent past to prove it.<br>
And an increasinglz large number of them were veterans of the war who came back posessed by the blood lust which posessed them
in the trenches.

These murders, however, were different. Each of the former targeted a certain people, operated on a certain method. The bodies that 
flooded our mortuaries during that time were of all walks of life, all ages - with no pattern to the madness.

It got so bad even the majority of criminaly did not dare to exit their hiding holes during moonless nights.
Only the really desperate could be seen couring under bridges and makeship shacks dimly lit by burning trash, praying to survive the night.

It is this setting, in which my story begins. My name is Johnathan Edwards and at the time I was a Corporal in *His Majesty's Army*.

I served on the frontline in Europe, wounded in action twice. The last one was supposed to get me out of all this, but shortly after
I arrived back home, I was re-drafted into the *Homeguard Brigade London*. An ad-hoc infantry formation mostly consisting of walking
wounded and recruits too young for the meatgrinder that is mainland Europe.<br>
The whole *Homeguard* thing was really more of a sharade. A reassurance to the upper classes, that more soldiers were deployed to 
protect them, their businesses and estates. At least you got paid - work was hard enough to find as it was.

It was the night of October 30th 1919. We were seven men, although calling all of them *men* may be a little generous.<br>
A young officer cadet - who, for some reason, was already a second lieutenant though he was barely out of the academy - named Clinton
and five conscripts who were between sixteen and seventeen years of age.<br>
I was the oldest of the bunch. With only 24 years. Because of that and my combat experience I was issued the only Enfield rifle our
unit had. The LT had his Webley revolver but the rest of the boys only got wooden clubs to defend themselves. Enough to beat up a burgler
or two, but not much more.

We were just coming down Redcross Street in St. Michael, a very nasty part of southern London at the time. It was dark, cold and the cobblestone
road was slippery from the pouring rain the days before. The few street lanters there were had been shut off as per usual and the full moon had trouble 
breaking through the thick clouds of coal smog hanging over the entire city like a greasy blanket. We were marching slowly down the dark street 
while being very careful not to bump into each other or slip on the wet ground.

I took a look around. The little moonlight there was drenched the boarded up restaurants, shops and theatres, which once lined this street, into
a black-blueish tint. The major advantages of a night patrol has always been - for me at least - the silence and the inability to see the immense 
suffering that plagued this city. In some spots, the dirty streets almost felt like regular patches of grass under once boots and when I closed my 
eyes and took a deep breath, I was almost able to smell the fresh wind pushing through the city, removing the stench of the day.

This time, however, when I formed the end of the formation, the wester breeze brought with it a stench I only knew too well: Blood and Death.

I exited the column and jogged up to the Lieutenant leading the formation.

"Sir!", I began, "Do you smell that too?" Clinton stopped us and looked up to me.

"What do you mean, Corporal? This whole part of town stinks.", he said quietly as to not offend any of the boys who might come from these parts.

"Indeed, Sir. But I think there is something down that alley. It stinks of rotten meat, Sir.", I explained and pointed down a narrow alley to our left,
where I presumed this smell originated from.

"You and your dog's nose, Corporal.", the LT chuckled, "The whole city stinks of rotten meat. Probably a pile of dead rats. Or rats feasting on a dead dog.
Either way I bet rats are involved." He looked me in the eyes and sighed: "Ugh, alright, Corporal. I trust your instincts. Go down there and report back what you find 
we will wait here."

I nodded and swung my rifle off my shoulder. The Lieutenant ordered the others to form a circle as I stepped towards the entry of the passage. 
The moonlight seemed powerless against the darkness which lay before me. I gripped my rifle firmly with both hands, the baynot extended.

*"Well,"*, I thought to myself, *"Can't be worse than thre trenches."*

Then I steppedd into the void.
