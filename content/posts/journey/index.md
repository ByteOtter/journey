## How I got here

My journey starts, how a lot of these stories begin, with me finishing school. There I was, 18 years old and no real plan for my future. The first few weeks after I got my diploma I just sat in my room schrolling through uni pages wondering what I would do with my life. I was not really good at math and did not see the point of studying anything like art, english or history, which I was really good at. What I did have though was an interest in technology. So, I did what any reasonable guy my age would do, follow the advice of my best friends and just sign up for the computer science bachelor course at my local uni.

Oh boy, was that a bad idea.

To sum it up, I failed. Horribly. Mainly because I lacked the mathematical background to understand what the math courses were even about.<br>
So, after the second semester, I did what any reasonable guy my age would do: Take the next best course: Human Computer Interaction.

This time I was better off. I was able to reapply what I learned about programming from the CS course and actually made progress. However, around the second or third semester I realised that this was not going to make me happy. The entire course was build around the idea that we...

a. Go into research and develop the next big interface design

or

b. Go into a company and tell the developers there that they are all wrong and that good interfaces look like this and that because my book told me so

neither of these options appealed to me really.<br>
So I left uni. At this point, I was quite miserable to be honest. I knew that I wanted to stay in the tech world I just did not see my path yet. My best friend, who I met during my first days of uni took my hand during this time and guided me through the `git` fundamentals and introduced me to open source software.

This is when I first really got into Linux too (might be worth a seperate blogpost at some point) and boi did I annoy the hell out of him because I did not know what I was doing half the time.

This went on for a couple months in which I also started my first own programming project and looked for a new opportunity. Which I then found (or rather my friend threw in my face): An apprenticeship with an open source software company. This was exactly what I dreamed of.<br>
Not only would I learn honest programming and software development, but also be trained at a company that embraced open source. So I applied and, to my luck, got accepted thanks to my uni background.

Now I am here. First year apprentice learning the job that I love and realizing how much I took away from uni.

I would say this is the moral of the story: Press on, even if you are unsure. Your path will reveal itself soon enough. But you must never give up.
