Hey There, Love!

Happy Transgender Day of Visibility to you!

Yes, yes I know I am a day late. To be honest, I was a little preoccupied with myself and didn't really know what to write.

But hey, better late than never - right?

I hope you spent your day well. If you were out on the street, thank you for raising your voice. Especially in these
times.
If you weren't protesting, I hope you still spent the day well - whether that meant resting, taking are of yourself, or
simply existing. All of which are just as important. ;)

The world right now is quite the opposite of kind to us. But even when the days are dark and the newsticker exhausting;
even when the fight for our rights - even those we thought we already had achieved - seems endless; It's important to
keep going. Because your existance is important. It is powerful. It is beautiful. And it is resistance. You are
a statement for all that is beautiful in the complexity of the human kind. For the diverse set of colors and shapes
humanity exists out of.

You are not alone. We have each other. And together, we will continue carving out our space, making our voices heard
and taking care of one another like we always do.

So please, keep going. Keep being you, in all your radiant, resilient and authentic way. Take breaks when you need them.
Lift each other up when you can. And never forget that your identity, your joy, your love and your presence in this world
matter - more than words can say.

To provide a little positive counterweight to everything in the news, let me list some facts for you:

- 70% of Germans believe that Trans* individuals deserve protection 
- Most proposed US bills to deminish or ban Trans* life fail
- Younger generations are more queer than ever - being able and feeling safe enough to voice their identity freely
- Gender affirming healthcare saves lifes on a daily basis
- Trans* people have always existed in many cultures throughout thousands of years - and they always will

Most of this information was taken from the [Ipsos Pride Study 2024](https://www.ipsos.com/sites/default/files/ct/news/documents/2024-05/Pride%20Report%20FINAL_0.pdf).
Which shows that there is still a path ahead of us, but that it's not all as bleak as the news or social media makes it seem.

Closing all of this there is only one thing to say to you: Hang in there! And,

> Trans* Rights Are Human Rights!

Thanks for reading, have a snuggly day.
With love, huggies and headpats.

Your,
