[In a less than recent blogpost](../project_spec_config/) I mentioned that I primarily use [LunarVim](https://lunarvim.org) as my
text editor / IDE of choice.

I would like to dive a little bit into my experiences and my specific setup as someone who mainly programs in Rust, Python and C.

## What is LunarVim?

First things first, what am I talking about?

LunarVim is a flavour of `NeoVim`, which itself is a fork of the classic `vim` terminal text editor. "Flavour" here means 
that it comes preconfigured with a bunch of plugins and themes that allow you to code similarly like you would with something like 
VSCode, a JetBrains product or something similar.

Language servers, autocompletion, snippets, file explorer, live grep and search are all features LunarVim comes with by default.
