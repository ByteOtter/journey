# School, the state and SUSE

I feel I should elaborate more about the apprenticeship I am in, as here in Germany these work a lot differently form what one might be used to in the US or someplace else.<br>
Believe me a lot of what I am going to write here will make more sense once I do, so bear with me.

You may be familiar with what I call *"the American system"* of apprenticeships: Someone applies for it and then, for a meager salary, or maybe even none at all, they are trained on the job at a certain company.<br>
Now, this is mostly the case here in Germany too except for one pretty big detail: Federal standards. In Germany, both the federal government and the Chamber of Industry and Commerce (ger.: IHK, eng: CIC), an organisation of state employees and industrial or trading companies, sit down together and set a standard for certain types of apprenticeships.<br>
These standards include the contents of what should be tought to the apprentices, how long an apprenticeship may last, if there are ways to cut the time of an apprenticeship, content and kind of exams, content of what apprentices are taught in school, etc etc. All that while following the federal youth protection and labour laws.<br>
This system ensures that, in theory, all apprentices no matter which company trained them have a baseline of knowledge not only from a techical standpoint (like e.g. fundamentals of programming) but also common knoledge like employee's rights, economics, english, etc.<br>
The latter is taken care of by what is called "Berufsschule" ("Job School") which apprentices generally must attend. (Exemptions are made for apprentices over the age of 18 who have completed at least one apprenticeship or uni program before). In school, which can be either regularly at one to two days a week, or as a block of two to three weeks at a time, we are taught the absolute fundamentals for our job. Here the baseline I mentioned is layed. As what is taught by our companies can vary widely in quantity and quality.<br>
After the exam we get a certificate which proves to future employers in Germany and Europe that we have completed a program and lists all skills we (should) have acquired in our apprenticeship as required by the federal government.

There are a lot of nuances to this system and the specifics change from state to state and from career to career but that is the gist of it.

That's it, now you know absolute unimportant things about the German apprenticeship program!

Thanks for reading!
