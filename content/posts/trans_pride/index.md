Hey there, friend. Happy Trans Awareness Month to you.

Please, sit down. If you want, get yourself a cup of tea or hot chocolate -- I'll wait here.

Ready?

Nice. I hope you are comfy.

So, those were some pretty rough months, huh? It's understandable if you feel exhausted or overwhelmed, or even scared.<br>
I just want to remind you that you are not alone in this. Not now, not ever.

I know things feel heavy sometimes, and right now you might feel soo many things at once -- overwhelmed, uncertain, or even scared about
what's happening to the world right now. I feel that too. As a baby-transfem, I'm walking this path beside you.
It's okay to be scared. Who wouldn't be in times like these? It's okay to feel like you don't have all the answers or
don't know what to do next - like everything feels like it's too much at once. We're all figuring this out as we go,
and that's absolutely fine.

There is something I want you to remember. Write it down if you have to: **You are valid. You are enough.
You are wonderful just the way you are.**<br>
Whether you're trans, nonbinary, genderfluid, cis or questioning -- whether you're gay, bi, pan, ace, or anywhere in
between or outside this spectrum -- we are all part of this wonderful and diverse community. Every single one of us
deserves love, respect and space to exist fully and freely.

During Trans Awareness Month, we're given opportunity to reflect, honor and amplify the voices of trans and gender-expansive
folks. But it's not just about awareness -- it's about **action**. It's about supporting one another, standing up for one another,
and doing whatever we can to make the world a safer, more inclusive space for all of us. Whether by speaking out about injustice,
donating to trans*-organizations, or simply checking in on each other. In times like these we all need a little extra love.
Our collective action matters. Big and small, loud and quiet. We have to stick together now more than ever. Because when one is hurt,
we can all feel it. And when one of us thrives, we all do.

I know things might feel bleak right now. The world and society can feel like it's turning on us, and the weight of it can be a lot to carry.
But, friend, I want you to remember something else: **It is okay to not be okay**. You don't have to have everything figured out right now.
You don't have to carry the burden of the world on your shoulders. It's okay to have moments of doubt, of frustration, of pain.
But please remember: **You are loved so much**. You are seen. You are precious. *And yes, things will get better*.

As someone, who has only recently discovered her true self, I often have to remind myself of that too.
Sometimes, I sit in these holes of agony not understanding what is going on, fearing the future. But it's important to reach out for help. I'm never alone. **You are never alone**.
We are all here for each other, whether we've known each other for years or we've just met. There's a strength in our community.
And that strength doesn't disappear just because some orange and old people won an election. They are out of touch with reality.

So, as we celebrate Trans Awareness Month together, take a moment to breathe. Take a sip of your hot chocolate or tea -- or whatever it is you are drinking -- and allow yourself
to accept that you are doing your best, and that your best *is enough*.

You deserve all the love and acceptance the world has to offer. You deserve to feel safe, happy, and at peace with who you are.

And if you're feeling lost or scared, please know I'm right here next to you.<br>
We're in this together you and I.

You are **valid**. You are **beautiful**. You are **worthy**. And **everything will be alright**. Pinky promise.

With love, huggies and headpats.

Your,

- Tiara /ᐠ ˵> ˕ <˵マ
