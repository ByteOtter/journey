Hey there friend. Happy to see you again.

Sit down, get comfy. I hope hot chocolate is okay. You can also get yourself some tea or whatever you like -- I wait for you.

You comfy? -- Sweet.

So, it's this time of year again, huh? The holidays are upon us. For many people, this means cozy lights, festive music and closeness to their loved ones.
But for a lot of us queer and trans* people -- especially the ones who are not out yet -- it also comes with stress, anxiety, tension and sometimes outright dread.
It's completely understandable if you feel this way. I feel the same, to be honest.

Family gatherings can be a lot to handle, I know. Maybe it's that one relative who just won't respect your name or pronouns. Maybe it's the offhand comments towards your partner -- or lack thereof --
or heavy silences when political topics come up. Or maybe it's worse -- something that leaves you feeling raw, unseen or even unsafe. Where your very indentity and or existance are called 
into question under the pretext of "just wondering" or "not being used to it".

People like this always use their age or a "lack of understanding/knowledge" as an excuse for their bigotry, and very quickly play the victim when called out. There is nothing for them to understand. 
Just the simple decision to accept and love you, or not.

Here's the thing I want to remind you of: **It's okay to not be okay**. It's okay to feel hurt, frustrated or exhausted. You're not *"too sensitive"*.
You're not overreacting. **Your feelings are valid, just like *you are valid***.

Let me say this clear: You don't owe anyone your time, your presence or your peace of mind. Not even your family. I know that can be a hard truth to sit with. 
A truth I still struggle to accept myself sometimes. But a truth nonetheless.
Since we were little, we were taught that family means everything. That we should grin, sit still and bear it for the sake of "keeping the peace", especially on holidays.
To not be a "drama queen". Not be the one who sticks out. The one who "starts trouble".
But you're not a blue helmet, are you? Your job is not to keep the peace. Especially not by sacrificing your own well-being.

It's okay to set boundaries. It's okay to say no. And it's okay to leave the table or even skip the gathering altogether if you need to protect yourself. That 
doesn't make you selfish or ungrateful. It makes you brave -- because choosing yourself in a world that so often tells us not to is one of the bravest things you can do.

Relation alone does not define family. Family are the people who love you, who take care of you, and who accept you for the person you are. They can be a best friend,
your partner, a mentor or a group of people you've found along your way. **Chosen family**. And let me tell you, chosen family is just as real, just as meaningful, 
and often more supportive than the one we're born into.

So, if your biological family doesn't feel like a safe place this holiday season, it's okay to celebrate with your chosen family instead. You are never alone.
We queer people are strong, we stick together -- especially in times like these. If you can, check in with your local trans* or LGBTQ+ groups to see if there are any holiday 
events planned. A lot of groups organize gatherings or safe spaces where you can connect with others who truly get you.
Even a virtual event can make you feel seen and supported.

And if you *do* decide to go to that family dinner, remember that you're not alone. Maybe you have a friend you can text druing the tough moments, 
or a supportive community online to check in with.
Sometimes even just having a plan to escape a stressful situation for a moment -- like an excuse to step outside to breathe -- can make a huge difference.

Whatever you choose to do this holiday season, know this: **You are enough, just the way you are. You are valid. You are wonderful. And you deserve love, joy and safety** -- 
not just during the holidays, but every single day.

Take care, friend. And if the holidays get tough, please remember: I'm right here next to you.

Merry christmas and happy holidays.

With love, cuddles and headpats.

Your,

- Tiara
