Hey there friend. Happy to see you again.

Sit down, get comfy. If you have not already, please get yourself a cup of tea or hot chocolate -- I wait for you.

Ready? -- Nice.

It's this time of year again, huh? The holidays are upon us. For many people, this means cozy lights, festive music and closeness to their loved ones.
But for a lot of us queer and trans* people -- especially the ones who are not out yet -- it also comes with stress, anxiety, tension and sometimes outright dread.

Family gatherings can be a lot to handle. Maybe it's that one relative who just won't respect your name or pronouns. Maybe it's the offhand comments or heavy silences 
when certain topics come up. Or maybe it's worse -- something that leaves you feeling raw, unseen or even unsafe.

Here's the thing I want to remind you of: **It's okay to not be okay**. It's okay to feel hurt, frustrated or exhausted. You're not *"too sensitive"*.
You're not overreacting. **Your feelings are valid, just like *you are valid***.

Let me say this clear: You don't owe anyone your time, your presence or your peace of mind. Not even your family. I know that can be a hard truth to sit with.
Since we were little, we're taught that family means everything. That we should grin, sit still and bear it for the sake of "keeping the peace", especially on holidays.
But you're not a blue helmet, are you? Your job is not to keep the peace. Especially not by sacrificing your own well-being.

It's okay to set boundaries. It's okay to say no. And it's okay to leave the table or even skip the gathering altogether if you need to protect yourself. That 
doesn't make you selfish or ungrateful. It make you brave -- because choosing yourself in a world that so often tells us not to is one of the bravest things you can do.

Relation alone does not define family. Family are the people who love you, who take care of you, and who accept you for the person you are. They can be a best friend,
your partner, a mentor or a group of people you've found along your way. **Chosen family**. And let me tell you, chosen family is just as real, just as meaningful, 
and often more supportive that the one we're born into.

So, if your biological family doesn't feel like a safe place this holiday season, it's okay to celebrate with your chosen family instead. You don't have to be alone, friend.
We queer people are strong, we stick together -- especially in times like these. If you can, check in with your local trans* or LGBTQ+ groups to see if there are any holiday 
events planned. A lot of groupts organize gatherings or safe spaces where you can connect with others who truly get you.
Even a virtual event can make you feel seen and supported.

And if you *do* decide to go to that family dinner, remember that you're not alone. Maybe you havea friend you can text druing the tough moments, or a supportive community online to check in with.
Sometimes even just having a plan -- like an excuse to step outside to breathe -- can make a huge difference.

Whatever you choose to do this holiday season, know this: **You are enough, just the way you are. You are valid. You are wonderful. And you deserve love, joy and safety** -- 
not just during the holidays, but every single day.

So, let's raise our cups (or imaginary ones, if yours is empty already) to you: To your courage, your resiliance and the beautiful person you are.

Take care, friend. And if the holidays get tough, please remember: I'm right here next to you.

Merry christmas and happy holidays.

With love, cuddles and headpats.

Your,

- Tiara
