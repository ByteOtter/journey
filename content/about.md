## About

Hi, welcome to my little headspace!

In case you do not know me that well, I am Tiara - or Tia -, a 26 year old software engineer who loves Open-Source Software and learning about tech.

In this place I will update you, irregularly, on my life, ongoing projects, events I attended or whatever else comes to mind.

Hope my rambling is fun to read!

I see you when I see you!

\- Tiara aka "ByteOtter"
