Welcome to my head-space!
{{< /typeit >}}

My name is Tiara - or just `Tia` for short.<br>
I am a 26 year old software engineer currently employed with an open source software company based in Germany.

In my spare time I love to train in martial arts and have relaxed discussions over a cup of mead.
